EXERCISE 5

In order to decide a movie to show,firstly you need to filter the movies that are common for all the persons. Then for this list of movies seen from every person you need to calculate the percentage of completion. The movie with the biggest average of these percentages will be the one that I would reccomend for this specific persons to watch again. To make it more clear if for the movie: 

"300"
Person1 has seen 80%
Person2 has seen 70%   -----> 70%
Person3 has seen 60%

and for the movie:

"The Intouchables"
Person1 has seen 10%
Person2 has seen 90%  -----> 50%
Person3 has seen 50%


so the method would return "300" as reccomended
